i refer to functions from my JS document.
My jS code is simple and probably not optimal, but i tried out different ways to write it, and learned alot.
first i will describe my objectm then say something about each function i made. 

variation: iphone 

1. brand and a model that i wrote in javascript to add to html they both have string values. 

2. color describe the color of the phone, this is also string values, but in array. 

3. storageCapacity describes the hard drive on the iphone, it has string vaules in a array. 

4.price describes the total price of the iphone, and it has number values.

5. background describes the background of the website, and it has a bolean value.



function0: makes the background of HTML and body to black/white, it also changes text color and border color.

 var storageBorder has several var because i couldn't make "foreach" or "querySelectorALL" to work. i know i can make this code "less code" later when i learn more about JS. im also not sure if "if" and "else" is the most optimal way to write the code in this setting, but i made it work. 



function1: this function creat text in HTML when you click each image, it shows the customer if the product in a spesific color is in stock or out of stock. i also made the text green for instock and red for out of stock. 

in this function i also use "if" and "else" with a bolean value, but here i made it work with a new var with two bolean values, and then used [number] to tell if the answer was "true" or "false". 



function2: This function create the var iphone.price when you click var iphone.storageCapacity first i made variables to the function to not hardcode the text, then i made number for each size and "linked" it to each ID in my HTML document so i could target each size by number(price). 

i know i could do something like this in function0.(insted of all the variables)
